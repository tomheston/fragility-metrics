# Fragility Metrics Toolkit

Open-source calculators for statistical fragility metrics in contingency tables.  
Current tools include:

- **PFI (Percent Fragility Index)**
- **RRI (Risk Residual Index)**
- **RQ (Risk Quotient)**

Additional calculators (FI, MeCI, etc.) will be added.

## Usage

1. Open the notebook in Colab (link above) and click Run.  
2. Enter your 2Ã—2 contingency table values (`a, b, c, d`) at the prompts.  
3. The script will compute:
   - **UFI** (unit fragility index)
   - **PFI** (percent fragility index)
   - **RRI** (risk residual index)
   - **RQ** (risk quotient)
